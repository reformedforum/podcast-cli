# podcast-cli
A script to assist in publishing podcast episodes through the command line.

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a command-line interface to assist in publishing podcast episodes. The publishing process is tedious and involves many steps that could be automated. Once an episode has been recorded, mastered, and exported as an mp3, the following steps still need to be completed.

* Create an ID3 tag with the program and episode specific metadata, including title, description, album art.
* Upload the file to the podcast host via FTP.
* Insert a record into our media distribution system.
